## Project 20: Hungry Snake Game

Make a clone of the old 'Hungry Snake' game that used to be on Nokia phones.
Where the snake must eat the randomly generated food items without hitting a wall or 
running into its own tail.
The game can be made more difficult by adjusting the interval at which the snake speed increases.
